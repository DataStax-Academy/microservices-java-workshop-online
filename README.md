In May 2020, the Spring engineering teams released Spring Boot 2.3.0 and Spring Data 3.0.0 that brought an upgrade to the latest version of the Cassandra Java driver. This driver upgrade provides full support for the newest major version of Cassandra 4.0 in these utilities that we'll showcase throughout the blog. The Spring and Cassandra communities are continuing to work together to provide tighter integrations with better health checks, metrics, and auto-configuration of the driver via application properties files.

*In this repository, you'll find everything you need from the online Cassandra Developer Workshop. Feel free to bookmark this page for future reference!*
